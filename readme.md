## About The Project

In this project, I aim to perform operations such as testing and managing CRUD operations by making use of the documentation of the relevant libraries in terms of contributing to the logic operations on the front-end side and understanding the operation, as well as understanding the way of managing the developments and functionality on the backend side with the trainings I have received.
